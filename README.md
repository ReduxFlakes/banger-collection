# C Collection

> **Warning**: Poor code ahead!

A collection of various C programs that I did in my computer science classes.

# Collections

At the moment I have three collections:

- [Collection 1](src/collection_1/) Simple programs
- [Collection 2](src/collection_2/) More complex programs that make use of functions
- [Collection 3](src/collection_3/) Random programs mostly of ASCII art
